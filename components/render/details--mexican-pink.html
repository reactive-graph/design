          Reporters hoping to evade other forms of surveillance by meeting in person with a source might want to rethink that practice. Every major newsroom
          covered by the data contained dozens of pings; we easily traced one Washington Post journalist through Arlington, Va.

          In other cases, there were detours to hotels and late-night visits to the homes of prominent people. One person, plucked from the data in Los Angeles

          phone.
