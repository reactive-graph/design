          But a number of companies do sell the detailed data. Buyers are typically data brokers and advertising companies. But some of them have little to do
          with consumer advertising, including financial institutions, geospatial analysis companies and real estate investment firms that can process and
          analyze
          such large quantities of information. They might pay more than $1 million for a tranche of data, according to a former location data company employee
          who agreed to speak anonymously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Location data is also collected and shared alongside a mobile advertising ID, a supposedly anonymous identifier about 30 digits long that allows
          advertisers and other businesses to tie activity together across apps. The ID is also used to combine location trails with other information like your
          name, home address, email, phone number or even an identifier tied to your Wi-Fi network.
        </p>
        <p class="first-graph">
          The data can change hands in almost real time, so fast that your location could be transferred from your smartphone to the app’s servers and exported
          to
          third parties in milliseconds. This is how, for example, you might see an ad for a new car some time after walking through a dealership.
        </p>
        <p>
          That data can then be resold, copied, pirated and abused. There’s no way you can ever retrieve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Location data is about far more than consumers seeing a few more relevant ads. This information provides critical intelligence for big businesses. The
          Weather Channel app’s parent company, for example, analyzed users’ location data for hedge funds, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles this
          year
          that was triggered by Times reporting. And Foursquare received much attention in 2016 after using its data trove to predict that after an E. coli
          crisis, Chipotle’s sales would drop by 30 percent in the coming months. Its same-store sales ultimately fell 29.7 percent.
