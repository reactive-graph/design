  <h1 class="rg-article-title">About the design system</h1>
  <p class="rg-article-intro">
    This is a design system for Reactive Graph websites and applications. It establishes a common design language,
    provides reusable coded components, and outlines high level guidelines for content and accessibility.

  <h3>Atomic Design</h3>
  <p class="intro">Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner.</p>
  <p>
    All components defined are categorized following the
    <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/">atomic design principles by Brad Frost</a>.

  <h3>Web Components</h3>
  <p class="intro">
    Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their
    functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Interoperability:</strong> The design system is reusable and work across different JavaScript frameworks or
    vanilla JavaScript projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Different Tech Stacks:</strong> The design system need to be shared across projects with diverse tech
    stacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Micro Frontends:</strong> The design system serves as a neutral interface between different parts of a
    micro frontend architecture.

  <h3>Graph Representation</h3>
  <p class="intro">
    The section about the graph representation defines how the
    <a href="/docs/graph-representation/type-system">type system</a> of the graph can be visualized. This means
    how look components, entity types and relation types. Furthermore, it also defines the appearance of
    <a href="/docs/graph-representation/instance-system">instances</a> (entity instances and relation instances).

  <h3>Flow Node Representation</h3>
  <p class="intro">
    The section about the flow node representation defines how the control flows can be visualized. This includes
    the visualization of <a href="/docs/flow-node-representation/flow-node">flow nodes</a> and their property sockets
    and the <a href="/docs/flow-node-representation/connector">connectors</a> which enables the data flow.
